# Hangman-using-pygame
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that I recreated using Python and Pygame, combining traditional gameplay with modern graphical design. Players attempt to uncover a hidden word by guessing letters, where correct guesses reveal parts of the word, and incorrect guesses contribute to drawing the hangman figure.
